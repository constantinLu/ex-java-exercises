    ava.lang.Math class has many useful methods to perform mathematical operations like exponential,
    logarithms, square roots, cube roots and trigonometric functions. Math class is a final class in and all it;s methods are static.
    In this post, we will see how to find trigonometric values like sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec and cot of an angle using sin(), cos()
    and tan() methods of Math class.
